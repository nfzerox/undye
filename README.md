Tested on macOS 26.0 (25A354) and macOS 26.1 (25B77). This script will replace your current Dock with an older Dock pre-extracted from macOS 26.0 beta 4, and installs Launchpad pre-extracted from macOS 26.0 beta 3. During installation, this script prints signing information from these pre-extracted apps so you can confirm they are authentic. To uninstall, run `~/Downloads/launchbad-revived-main/run` again.
